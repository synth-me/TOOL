# Ramen.js 
`ramen.js` is a toolbox to assist graphical development for EBO software.

## Objetive:
All the features included in this library are made to simplify the process of interface design in EBO. 
I spotted that most of our programmers spent valuable time in repetitive tasks like copying and pasting code 
or even allocating memory for variables that should not exist solely because TGML Script did not have
the ergononimcs to avoid it. This libary was designed to solve this kind of problems. 

## Main Features:

1. Curried Objects
2. Simplfied Attributions of events
3. Simplfied Attribute Access
4. JS Modernized Features
